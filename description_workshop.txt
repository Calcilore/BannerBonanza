[h1]Overview[/h1]
Banner Bonanza lets you combine all of your banners into one, easy to maintain Banner Rack.

First, craft a Banner Rack from Rope, Glass, Topaz, and Stylish Scissors at a Heavy Work Bench and place it.

Next, right click on the Banner Rack while holding banners and they will be transferred to the Banner Rack.

You will receive the banner buff for all banners stored in the Banner Rack!

Right click on Banner Rack for a hint on which banner to work towards next.

Hover over a Banner Rack to see the progress on your collection.

You may be wondering how to get Stylish Scissors. The Stylist drops it rarely, so you'll have to be a bit cruel with the lava buckets, but it is well worth the guilt.
